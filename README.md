# Group 49 Project

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many students are learning virtually. The lack of in-person interaction with teachers has led many students to experience a decline in their mathematics and science skills. Our product will enable students to test their knowledge in core subjects according to the Florida Standards. Students will be informed of which topics they should further study based on questions they answer incorrectly.

This app supports teachers in assessing the following grades/subjects
- 1st grade Math and Science
- 2nd grade Math and Science
- 3rd grade Math and Science
- 4th grade Math and Science
- 5th grade Math and Science

Upon logging in, teachers are able to declare which subject and grade they teach. From there they can add students to their class, and see how their students are performing. 
When students log in, they have the option of taking both Science and Math quizzes designed to test their knowledge and provide immediate feedback on their capability in different education standards. Their performance is saved until reassessment is required. 

# Installation

`git clone https://github.com/DeyMoinak/Software-Engineering-Project`

This will install "from source" in the android studio environment. Upon cloning, the JDK does not default to the correct version. Follow the prompts to change it to the embedded JDK. From here it can be ran on the Pixel 3a virtual device running the R system image.
